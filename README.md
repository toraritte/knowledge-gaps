(Another) experiment to keep track of all the things I don't know. When learning or reading something new and see something that is intriguing (or don't immediately understand), I jump into a research frenzy, end up with min. 15 new chrome pages, save the bookmarks, and then struggle to find them among thousands. Worst case, I redo the whole thing a couple more times in the future. (For example, I saw a twitter post about Beaker Browser, went to the docs, jumped to IPFS, then to DAT, then to Pijul and so on.)

The notion:

 + Open an issue with the topic of interest
 + Start adding links and notes during my altered state of mind
 + Somehow make this work in the long run
